## Diagonal Difference

### Specifications

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

#### Examples

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17
Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2


11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
